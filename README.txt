There are four (4) notebooks in this folder, covering all three (3) stages of our fact-checking pipeline project:

Stages:

Stage 1 – Retrieval
Develop and evaluate a memory-efficient retriever + reranker system to identify top-k evidence passages for each claim.

Stage 2 – Classification
Use retrieved evidence to classify claims into SUPPORTED, REFUTED, or NOT_ENOUGH_INFO using supervised and in-context learning.

Stage 3 – Advanced Reasoning
Explore Chain-of-Thought prompting and ensemble strategies to improve evidence-based claim verification.

Notebooks:

1. *_Stage1.ipynb: Contains all experimental setups and results for Stage 1.

2. *_Stage2&3.ipynb: Contains the initial/baseline run for Stage 2 & 3.

3. *_Stage2&3_train_claim.ipynb: Experiments for Stage 2 & 3 performed using the train-claims dataset.

4. *_Stage2&3_dev_claim.ipynb: Experiments for Stage 2 & 3 performed using the dev-claims dataset.
